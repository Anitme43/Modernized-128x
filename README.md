# Modernized 128x

Modernized 128x is a texture pack for Minecraft: Java Edition version 1.19. It was forked from ModernArch 181 and modified to incorporate rendering & texure issue fixes aswell as adding/updating certain textures to cooperate with 1.19 blocks & tileset. This texture pack will be updated consistently. It is not well battle-tested, so if you uncover any bugs in the textures or have ideas feel free to open an Issue to have the matter addressed.

# Contribution
Any and all contribution is very much appreciated, whether that is texture updates, adding textures, or just fixing grammatical issues. Feel free to open a pull request to get your contribution approved and officially added to the texture pack. Thank you!
